## Compile a new Build

From the working jaggery library directory run to compile a build for your changes

```bash
yarn build
```

> For testing on local cloned Jaggery, you can point the package.json dependencies definition of jaggery to the location where your locally cloned jaggery is.

## Upgrade Dependencies

Users of the modified library, have to run to stay updated with the changes

```bash
yarn upgrade jaggery
```

and then make necessary changes to the component definition accordingly
